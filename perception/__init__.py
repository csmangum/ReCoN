"""
Perception Package.

This package provides utilities for synthetic scene generation and feature extraction
that serve as the sensory/perceptual layer for ReCoN networks. It includes:

- Synthetic dataset generation with geometric shapes
- Basic feature extraction algorithms (edge detection, intensity)
- Terminal unit activation mapping from visual features

These components enable ReCoN networks to process visual information and learn
to recognize patterns in 2D scenes through hierarchical feature composition.
