"""
ReCoN Core Package.

This package contains the fundamental implementation of the Request Confirmation
Network (ReCoN) algorithm, including:

- Core data structures (Graph, Unit, Edge)
- State machines and message passing (Engine)
- Network topology definitions (enums)
- Learning utilities for weight adaptation

The ReCoN algorithm implements hierarchical, message-passing networks that can
learn to recognize complex patterns through coordinated activation dynamics.
