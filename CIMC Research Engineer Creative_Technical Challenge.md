# CIMC Research Engineer Challenge Tasks

We have five options for the creative/technical challenge task, each of which demonstrates a different set of technical and creative strengths. Choose whichever task you feel most excited about, and would best reflect your abilities. 

We expect these challenges to take about a week of part-time effort. They’re meant to be open-ended, and hopefully fun\! Of course, we're looking for solutions that work, but your approach also matters: we're looking to see how you scope the problem, the design choices you make, the clarity and creativity of your solution, the personality and ambition you bring to your work, and how you explain your decisions. Please document your work in a way that helps us understand your process, limitations, and trade-offs.

We’re genuinely excited to see how you interpret these prompts and what you choose to build. We hope you find inspiration in the prompts ahead, and an opportunity to build something creative and beautiful. Let your imagination be your lead\!

**Reminder:** No more than 7 days after your challenge start, go to the [Submission Form](https://forms.gle/HZ38zagDMx6zRvGX9) to submit your solution in whatever form you wish: a zip/tar file, notebook, link to a repo, webpage, or drive, etc.

Please make sure your submission is in by Sept. 24, 2025\!

## Challenge Option 1: Latent Journey

Choose some embedding or generative model’s latent space (e.g., audio, visual, text, multimodal), and perform a live interactive exploration through that space using a human interface of your choice (e.g., GUI, mouse navigation, keyboard, joystick, voice control, VR/AR headset, body motion tracking). Bonus for creativity of the interface and for making the exploration a surprising, useful or meaningful journey.  
What we want to see: interface with existing AI models in novel ways, demonstrate practical understanding of how present AI approaches encode reality, show off your skills in building interfaces.

## Challenge Option 2: Font Space

Discover the latent space of fonts. Visualize the influence of the most important principal components; develop a tool to encode fonts in a useful encoding scheme (e.g., as a vector of numerical parameters) so that you can encode (almost) arbitrary existing fonts, and to navigate the font space using a suitable interface. Bonus for building something creative with the font space, e.g., a tool to generate new hybrid fonts, an interactive visualization that lets a user explore font styles, or discovering unexpected semantic associations (e.g., mood, cultural context, usage domain, stylistic qualities).  
What we want to see: a methodical approach to solving a training/data collection/encoding problem, pragmatic solutions for interface and possible applications.

## Challenge Option 3: Blender Scene

Create a blender scene from a camera image with some pre-defined objects of your choice. Bonus if you can recognize the direction of a human head and variable light sources. Perhaps you can even model and recognize novel objects?  
What we want to see: interfacing between an AI model and an existing app, understanding of modeling visual scenes, scene graphs, object representations.

## Challenge Option 4: Speech-to-Visualization

Create a live “speech-to-visuals” application. Listen to a person speaking and generate evolving visualizations in real time that reflect what’s being said. Bonus for meaningful mappings (e.g., topics, sentiment, rhythm, emphasis, speaker changes) and for an interface that feels expressive or performative.  
What we want to see: curiosity and creativity about bridging the gap between human intention and expression within AI models, practical skills in building a demo that is interesting to use.

## Challenge Option 5: Request Confirmation Networks

Build a working implementation and dynamic visualization of a Request Confirmation Network (ReCoN) as described in this paper: [https://ceur-ws.org/Vol-1583/CoCoNIPS\_2015\_paper\_6.pdf](https://ceur-ws.org/Vol-1583/CoCoNIPS_2015_paper_6.pdf)   
Demonstrate the use of a ReCoN to solve an interesting representation problem. Bonus for implementing additional components not covered in the paper, such as learning new representation, conversion into different formats, etc.  
What we want to see: Ability to understand and implement a novel theoretical idea, translating between representation and user interface.
